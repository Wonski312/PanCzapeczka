# UNFINISHED PROJECT

This is my first attempt to try and make the website for real customer. Learned a lot from it unfortunetly the customer turned out to not have time to make pictures of the items to put on the website as he has a lot of new items every week. And whats gone is gone so he would have to completly change his bussines to get it started for real.

The main goal was to get started with his bussines in the internet from the stationery shop.

I've spend a quite a bit of time on it so didn't want it go to waste.


On this website I've implemented small admin website which is locked only for one user.

If any one is intrested it can be accessed by change in url for admin.html and input panczapeczka@gmail.com / 1234567;

There the items can be added or removed from the main page.
So to the project everything was done as required, I would be happy to cary on with the project where I had to implemet the shop feture later on.

Technology and services:

HTML, SASS, JAVASCRIPT, GULP(code minifires), Rest API, FireBase Database, Authentication.
